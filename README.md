The Medical Imaging De-Identification Initiative (MIDI) comprises multiple sub-projects such as the development of test data sets with synthetic PHI, 
the deployment and customization of automated de-identification pipelines, and the verification of the output of the de-identification pipelines.

As a provider of clinical data for cancer research, NCI must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations 
that apply to hosting public data repositories. These regulations require the de-identification (de-ID) or removal of protected health information (PHI) 
and other personally identifiable information (PII) from datasets before data can be placed in the public domain.  Automated image de-identification 
that is scalable, customizable, and preferably cloud-based has become necessary due to the increasing demand for large datasets by artificial intelligence 
and machine learning efforts. 

Automated image anonymization algorithms and pipelines must be validated before they are deployed for the processing of imaging and clinical data that 
will be hosted by NCI image repositories.
